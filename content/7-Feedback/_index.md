### General Feedback

**1. Working Environment**  
During my training at AWS, I found the working environment to be highly professional and dynamic. Everyone communicates clearly and directly, making discussions comfortable and efficient. What I appreciated the most is the “learning by doing” culture – encouraging hands-on practice rather than relying solely on theory. However, I think AWS could consider organizing more internal sharing sessions so interns can better understand the responsibilities of different teams.

**2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**  
My mentor was extremely supportive, providing clear guidance before each task. Whenever I encountered difficulties, the mentor didn’t solve the problem for me but instead helped me think in the right direction – which significantly improved my problem-solving skills. The admin team also responded quickly, assisting with accounts, permissions, and documentation whenever needed.

**3. Relevance Between Tasks and My Major**  
The training topics were closely related to my major in Information Security, especially IAM, cloud security architecture, and AWS resource management. I also had the opportunity to work with technologies and tools that are not covered in my university curriculum, which helped broaden my knowledge considerably.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
Throughout the internship, I gained various new skills such as log analysis, applying AWS best practices, handling simulated incidents, and managing cloud resources. Besides technical skills, I also improved my communication, planning, and time-management abilities thanks to working with sprints and clear deadlines.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team spirit was excellent. Everyone was willing to help each other and openly share their experiences. The working environment was professional yet friendly, making it easy to interact and collaborate. This helped me integrate quickly and become more confident during technical discussions.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The policies for interns were clear and flexible. The working schedule was well-adjusted to accommodate my academic commitments. Moreover, being allowed to participate in internal workshops and technical training sessions was a big advantage.

### Additional Questions

- What were you **most satisfied with** during the internship?  
  → Having the chance to work directly with real AWS services and receiving timely, constructive support from my mentor.

- Would you **recommend this internship** to your friends? Why?  
  → Yes. Because the training environment is professional, well-structured, and provides hands-on experience that few other places offer.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- It would be great to have more group-based mini projects for additional practical experience.  
- If possible, I would like to continue in a more advanced program such as the AWS Internship or Cloud Engineer Trainee track.  
- I hope to see more deep-dive content related to cloud security and AI applications in system monitoring.
